# Dropdown-JS
Description: Placeholder dropdown menu code using mainly javascript.
Notes: Have fun with this stupid code, but make sure you understand what it does or it is useless.
	Feedback is appreciated, but I prefer understanding what the line does to it being efficient on this one

I think this is ugly, so I will be learning transition for future projects, but this is fine for now.
	The only reason I did it this way was so I could understand it and be in control.
